                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Kronos, designated <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span>, is a genetically engineered theropod dinosaur created as part of the <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span> project. It was intended to be the ultimate predator, combining traits from various species to create an apex hunter with unparalleled strength, speed, and intelligence. Kronos was the only successful specimen of its kind, with all other attempts either failing to survive or being terminated due to instability.</p>
                <h2>Incident Report: <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span></h2>
                <p>On <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span>, during routine maintenance of its enclosure, Kronos managed to breach its containment protocols. The exact method of escape remains classified, though it is believed that a combination of <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span> and unforeseen <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span> allowed it to bypass security measures. Once free, Kronos disappeared into the dense jungle surrounding the facility, leaving no trace except for the remains of several unfortunate personnel.</p>
                <h2>Physical Description</h2>
                <p>Kronos stands at an estimated height of <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span> and is believed to weigh over <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span> tons. Its appearance is a terrifying amalgamation of features from various predatory dinosaurs, including the <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span>, <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span>, and <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span>. Its skin is covered in thick, dark scales that provide camouflage in low-light environments, and its eyes possess a night vision capability that allows it to hunt effectively in complete darkness.</p>
                <h2>Behavioral Traits</h2>
                <p>Kronos exhibits an unusual level of intelligence for a dinosaur, displaying problem-solving abilities and a capacity for strategic thinking. It has been observed using <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span> to track prey and avoid detection. Kronos's behavior is highly unpredictable, making it an extremely dangerous entity. It seems to possess a deep-seated aggression, possibly as a result of the genetic manipulation it underwent.</p>
                <h2>Current Status</h2>
                <p>Despite numerous attempts to recapture or neutralize Kronos, it remains at large. All encounters with the creature have ended in failure, with several search teams disappearing without a trace. It is now considered one of the most dangerous creatures on the planet, and its location is classified as a top-priority threat zone. The public is unaware of Kronos's existence, and all information regarding it is strictly <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span>.</p>
                <h2>Warning</h2>
                <p>Kronos is not to be approached under any circumstances. If sighted, all personnel are advised to retreat immediately and contact <span class="glitch">[REDACTED]</span>. The full extent of its capabilities is still unknown, and it is believed that Kronos may possess abilities that have yet to be documented.</p>
